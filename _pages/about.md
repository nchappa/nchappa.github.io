As a **Research Post-Doctoral Fellow in Computational Approaches and Machine Learning** at the <a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car">Center for Autism Research</a> in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, I work under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/people/birkan-tunc">Dr. Birkan Tun√ß</a>, developing innovative computational approaches for autism research. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the University of Arkansas (January 2021 - February 2025), where my dissertation <strong>"Vision-Based Multimodal Approaches in Human Behavior Analysis: Bridging Group Activity Recognition and Healthcare Monitoring"</strong> was conducted under <a href="https://uark-cviu.github.io/contact.html">Prof. Khoa Luu</a> in the <a href="https://uark-cviu.github.io">Computer Vision and Image Understanding Lab</a>.

My research expertise encompasses human behavior analysis with multimodal data, visual temporal modeling, vision-language models (VLMs), and foundational models. My work spans applications including group activity recognition, healthcare monitoring, and responsible AI for content moderation. I previously earned an M.S. in Computer Engineering from Purdue University (2020) and a B.Tech in ECE from JNTU-K (2018).

With publications in venues like WACV, CVPR Workshops, and journals including Sensors and IEEE Access, I continue to advance the field by integrating advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to address real-world challenges in healthcare and beyond.
