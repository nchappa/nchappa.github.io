As a **Final Year Ph.D. Candidate** in Computer Engineering at the University of Arkansas, I am actively engaged in cutting-edge research within the <a href="https://uark-cviu.github.io">Computer Vision and Image Understanding Lab</a>, under the mentorship of <a href="https://uark-cviu.github.io/contact.html">Prof. Khoa Luu</a>. Prior to embarking on my doctoral journey, I earned an M.S. in Computer Engineering from Purdue University in May 2020 and a B.Tech in ECE from JNTU-K in April 2018.

My research expertise centers on the dynamic intersection of deep learning, machine learning, and their practical applications in the realm of computer vision. With a keen focus on advancing image and video understanding systems, my overarching goal is to cultivate a versatile skill set that seamlessly integrates academic prowess with industry relevance. I aspire to contribute meaningfully as both a proficient engineer and an influential scientist in the field.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
